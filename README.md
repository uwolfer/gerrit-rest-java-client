Introduction
-----------

Java implementation of the [Gerrit Code Review Tool] REST API.

Only Gerrit 2.6 or newer is supported (missing / incomplete REST API in older versions).

This implementation is used for example as base for the [Gerrit IntelliJ Plugin].

Many different authentication-methods are supported (HTTP basic, HTTP digest, LDAP with form,
HTTP password from Gerrit setting, ...).

[Gerrit IntelliJ Plugin]: https://github.com/uwolfer/gerrit-intellij-plugin


Usage
-------
This library implements <code>[com.google.gerrit.extensions.api.GerritApi]</code>.

You just need a few lines to get it working:
```java
GerritRestApiFactory gerritRestApiFactory = new GerritRestApiFactory();
GerritAuthData.Basic authData = new GerritAuthData.Basic("http://localhost:8080");
// or: authData = new GerritAuthData.Basic("https://example.com/gerrit", "user", "password"");
GerritApi gerritApi = gerritRestApiFactory.create(authData);
List<ChangeInfo> changes = gerritApi.changes().query("status:merged").withLimit(10).get();
```

If you like to write a script instead of a full Java application, you might want to use [Groovy].
There is a [basic Groovy example] available.

_Note:_ It is not guaranteed that all interfaces are implemented. If an implementation is missing, you get a
<code>com.google.gerrit.extensions.restapi.NotImplementedException</code>. Feel free to implement it and create a pull
request at GitHub - it is quite easy! :)

_Note:_ The source of <code>com.google.gerrit.extensions</code> is included in this repository at the
moment because not all extensions to this API are merged into Gerrit repository yet.

Maven Artifact
--------------
Releases are available with Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.urswolfer.gerrit.client.rest</groupId>
    <artifactId>gerrit-rest-java-client</artifactId>
    <version>0.8.7</version>
</dependency>
```

Android Support
---------------
Apache HttpClient causes problems on Android platform. There is a workaround by using [HttpClient for Android].
Android support builds are not officially released, but you should be able to create your own build by using the
[httpclient-android branch]. You probably want to merge master branch into this branch before building it.

[HttpClient for Android]: https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-4.5.x/android-port.html
[httpclient-android branch]: https://github.com/uwolfer/gerrit-rest-java-client/tree/httpclient-android

Dependencies
------------
This library depends on [Apache HttpClient], [Gson] and [Guava].
